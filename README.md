Javascript Minesweeper
======

### Objective
Trying to create a simple minesweeper game with plain old javascript and a dash of html and css.

I have heard of this idea being used as a coding exercise for potential hires and thought I would give it a try with my newly skills.

#### The Plan
- Make the game components in javascript
- Draw the game using html canvas
